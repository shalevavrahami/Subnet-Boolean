# Subnet-Boolean
The program will take for arguments:
1) a string (char pointer) network address with subnet (ex. 10.0.0.0/x or 255.255.255.0)
2) a string (char pointer) IP address (ex. 10.0.1.2)  

The program will calculate the subnet binary between network-subnet and IP-subnet and will print a result if the given IP is in the given network with given subnet.

*Very recommended to read the functions documentation in the file.
